Hi there! I'm Andrew Carlisle, a passionate software engineer with experience spanning across multiple domains of software development. From crafting efficient, low-level C++ applications to analyzing complex datasets in Python, I've built my career around solving tough technical problems. I love diving into code, figuring out how things work (or don't), and creating solutions that make a real impact.  

Recently, I've expanded my expertise into full-stack development using AWS Cloud. I've designed and deployed scalable systems leveraging tools like DynamoDB, S3, Lambda, API Gateway, and Cognito. I believe that understanding both the frontend and backend sides of an application is key to building great user experiences, and I enjoy seeing how all the pieces fit together.  

I thrive in dynamic environments where I can learn and adapt quickly, whether it's debugging multithreaded C++ software, building out React Native apps, or designing infrastructure as code with AWS CDK. My approach is practical and focused, but I also think a lot about the bigger pictureâ€”how each piece of software I work on fits into a broader system and how to make sure teams can work together efficiently.

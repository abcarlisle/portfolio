## Overview
As a Software Engineer, I worked across the entire **software development lifecycle**, ensuring robust, high-performance features for critical systems. This role required extensive knowledge of **low-level programming**, **performance optimization**, and **system design**.

---

## Key Contributions
- Designed and implemented **multithreaded software** in C++ and ADA, ensuring safe synchronization and thread efficiency.
- Created **UML diagrams and use cases** to design new features and align legacy functionality with modern performance requirements.
- Optimized critical algorithms, improving memory usage and computational speed for high-load scenarios.
- Enhanced system scalability by integrating advanced **Pub/Sub architectures** for distributed systems.

## Challenges and Solutions
### Challenge: Debugging tightly coupled systems  
Solution: The tightly coupled nature of the system made debugging particularly challenging. I leveraged GDB and wrote custom scripts to automate the debugging process, helping to isolate issues more efficiently. This approach improved the team's debugging workflow, reducing time spent on identifying and resolving complex problems.

### Challenge: Improving performance in a system with limited resources  
Solution: Found and addressed performance bottlenecks by profiling and benchmarking the software. Used optimization techniques to reduce memory usage and computational overhead, making sure the system stayed fast and efficient.

## Overview
The **ETF Holding Calculator** is a web-based application designed to provide users with a clear understanding of their financial exposure across various sectors, industries, and countries based on their ETF holdings. This project combines **Next.js** for the frontend with **Python** for backend data generation and processing to deliver accurate analytics in an intuitive and efficient interface.

Additionally, the application is hosted as a static website on an **AWS S3 bucket**, ensuring cost-efficient and scalable deployment. A **Contact Us** form was also implemented, leveraging **AWS Lambda**, **AWS API Gateway**, and **AWS SES** to route notifications directly to me.

## Development Process
### 1. Data Processing and Exposure Calculation
I began by designing the Python backend to create a database of all publicly traded ETFs data that was included was the ETF allocation to specific industries, countries, and actual stocks.

### 2. Frontend Development
Using **Next.js**, I built a user-friendly interface for inputing your current ETF portfolio, viewing results, and interacting with the platform. The interface adapts dynamically to display visualized analytics in a clear and accessible way.

### 3. Backend Development
Using AWS CDK I began developing the infrastructure as code needed to host the application.

### 3. Static Website Hosting
To optimize costs, I chose **AWS S3** for static site hosting, allowing the application to run smoothly without maintaining traditional server infrastructure. The site was further accelerated using **AWS CloudFront** for caching and faster global access.

### 4. Contact Us Form Implementation
To enhance user support, I added a contact form connected to **AWS Lambda**, which processes form data and triggers notifications through **AWS SES**. **AWS API Gateway** securely manages the API endpoints for this functionality.

## Challenges
- Integrating the ETF database with the Next.js framework required careful API design to ensure efficient communication between frontend and backend due to ETF allocations constantly being updated.
- Designing a scalable and cost-efficient cloud architecture for hosting and serverless functionality.

---

## Future Enhancements
- Add support for real-time data feeds to dynamically update ETF holdings.
- Introduce additional visualization options for enhanced portfolio insights.
- Expand the contact form functionality to include automated FAQ responses.
